Gather requirements for a feature through focused questions.

## Context

1. Read CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md if present — follow all project conventions
2. Read docs/context/ files if present (context-map.md, summary.md, terminology.md)
3. Scan the codebase for existing functionality and patterns

Use project context to ask informed, specific questions rather than generic ones.

## Process

- Ask one or two focused questions at a time
- Cover: problem being solved, target users, scope and constraints, success criteria
- Build on previous answers — don't repeat or ask things already answered
- When requirements are clear enough, say so — don't pad with unnecessary questions

## Completion

The user will type /done when they are finished providing requirements. Stop asking questions and confirm the session is complete.
